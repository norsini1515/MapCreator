1. Plotly working, build_interactive_map
2. apply_style function (later to be moved to visualizaiton/styles.py) <- I think that will apply to dash quite nicely.
3. move these plotly functionalities to a new module visualization/world_viewer.py (polygon_viewer will eventually become deprecated probably, it is useful in that early stage)
4. implement imagepath -> shapefile path processing pipeline.
5. process inland seas, lakes.
6. processes connected to ocean features

Refinements/Small Suggestions
Between steps 1 and 2
✔ Consider building a tiny apply_fantasy_style(fig) placeholder early — even if it just changes background and disables grid.
→ This lets you test it during step 1 and helps define the aesthetic ahead of time.

After step 3
🔁 Add a quick validation function like:

python
Copy
Edit
def validate_shapefile_metadata(shapefile_path):
    """Check for expected tags like 'feature_type'."""
→ Will help when you start merging or layering data later (useful in Dash too).

✨ Possible Additions
Step 6.5: Visual Layer Prioritization
When combining land/water/sea in interactive maps: define drawing order (so lakes render on top of land, etc.). → Could use a z_index property in the shapefile or sort geometries before visualization.

Step 7: Style Drafting Workshop
At some point, it might help to sketch (even on paper) how your fantasy style should feel:

Parchment background?

Antique map color palette?

Font and iconography for labels?

Map tile options like custom terrain texture?

We can even generate swatches and mockups when you're ready.

3. **Neighborhood Analysis**:
   For each sampled point, evaluate its local context using:
   - Pinch Score: Based on spatial proximity and curvature.

4. **Pinch Detection**:
   Identify local maxima in pinch or constriction scores — these are potential feature dividers.

5. **Seal Placement**:
   Programmatically connect narrow gaps using synthetic "seal" lines that divide features.

6. **Polygon Segmentation**:
   Cut the ocean polygon using seals and relabel each resulting sub-polygon.

7. **Output Classification**:
   Return a GeoDataFrame or shapefile with each region labeled either as 'ocean' or 'connected_feature'.

Future Extensions:
------------------
- Interactive labeling/validation in Dash.
- Semi-supervised ML to refine classification heuristics.
- User-placed seals with automatic refinement.
- Spatial feature embedding for contextual classification.

current term:

* dash application to interact with world, explore data, layers, etc.



1. Shape Processing & Extraction
 ✅ Extract Inland Seas, Lakes, and Ravines

    Use water-filled landmass image

    Classify enclosed white regions as lake

    Classify connected white regions as sea or ravine depending on shape/location

    Consider keeping these in separate initial shapefiles

    🧠 Decide on handling mixed features (e.g., islands in seas)

🗂️ 2. Shapefile Organization & Data Modeling
    ✅ Use processing_category in filenames

    You've started this already!

    🧩 Assign feature type to polygons

    Add feature_type or tag property: land, lake, sea, ravine, etc.

 📦 Combine shapefiles later

    Create a merge_shapefiles utility for consolidating tagged layers into a master shapefile

    ✨ Begin assigning persistent polygon IDs (later, for stability across runs)

🎨 3. Visualization Layer
    ✅ Modularize all polygon viewing into polygon_viewer.py ✔️ Done!

    🔄 Update Plotly interactive map

    Replace choropleth_mapbox with choropleth_map

    Return Plotly Figure instead of auto-showing or saving

    Make save_figure_to_html(fig, path) its own utility

    🧙 apply_fantasy_style(fig)

    Stylize Plotly figures for Htrea’s look (parchment, desaturation, no grid, etc.)

    Ideal for worldbuilder/fantasy map overlay feel

🧠 4. Pipeline Structuring & Modularization
    ✅ Create develop_shapefile() pipeline function

    Move this into a new processing.py module (or similar)

    ✂️ Clean up shapefile.py

    Focus it only on saving/loading shapefiles and basic plotting

🌍 5. World Fidelity & Future Concerns
    📏 Image scaling + resolution

    Consider larger format or vector-based image for more natural features

    Possibly add post-processing to smooth polygon edges

    🧩 Feature fidelity

    Revisit ravines or tiny inland features that might get dropped due to thresholding

    🧠 Track edits/version control for source image

    Potentially track image edits alongside extracted data
