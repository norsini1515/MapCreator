Ray-Based Ocean Subdivision: Summary & Roadmap
🎯 Core Objective
Identify natural subregions of the ocean (bays, inlets, fjords, ravines) by analyzing ray-casting behavior.

Use these to guide seal placement, region tagging, and future export for game mods or GIS.

✅ Methodology So Far
Ray-casting

From each coastline point, emit rays and record:

start_point, end_point

angle, distance

hit_type (coastline vs. boundary)

Filtering

Focus on coastline hits

Optionally keep only the shortest X% of rays to target enclosed features

DBSCAN Clustering on (x, y) of end_point

No need to predefine cluster count

Automatically finds dense zones and labels noise

Interactive Visualization

Matplotlib for quick checks

Plotly for interactive, categorical color-coded cluster maps

Overlaid (optionally) on land/ocean GeoJSON layers

⚠️ Challenges Identified
Euclidean distance only: clusters may “jump” across peninsulas or islands.

No ground truth: hyperparameters (eps, min_samples) are tuned by eye.

Clustering ignores ray direction and origin context.

Some clusters are too small or too fragmented to be meaningful.

🧭 Next Directions
1. Enrich Clustering Input
Incorporate angle, ray length, start point into feature vectors

Try multivariate clustering or dimensionality reduction + clustering

2. Build a Land-Aware Connectivity Graph
Nodes = ray endpoints

Edges only if the straight line does not cross land

Use NetworkX connected components instead of raw DBSCAN

3. Overlay & Validate Clusters
Draw concave/convex hulls per cluster

Render clusters on top of the ocean/land mask for visual QA

4. Seal Placement Logic
Identify bottlenecks between clusters or high-density edges

Auto-generate “seals” at narrow passages (midpoints, perpendicular cuts)

5. Scoring & Interpretation
For each cluster compute:

Mean ray length

Directional entropy

Origin diversity

Use these metrics to rank and classify subregions (e.g., “hidden fjord” vs. “open bay”)

🧩 Longer-Term Ideas
Experiment with HDBSCAN and custom distance metrics

Rasterize land/water for cost-distance clustering

Simulate flow lines or streamlines on rays for dynamic insights




🧠 What This Means
1. Feature inclusion alone isn’t enough
We added good features (angle, start point, distance), but:

DBSCAN is still clustering based on distance in feature space

That space may not align with geographic coherence

It’s possible some of the added features are actually introducing noise (e.g., small angle differences creating separability that’s irrelevant for structure)

2. We’re still clustering isolated points, not flows or regions
Rays are structural elements, not just data points

Their meaning lies in how they relate to terrain, and how they connect spatial zones

✅ Next Step: Rethink Clustering Target
Instead of clustering rays directly, we might now:

🔹 1. Aggregate rays into zones, then cluster those zones
For example:

Rasterize the ocean into a grid

For each cell, record:

Number of ray endpoints inside

Mean direction (vector field)

Ray count from which directions

Then cluster cells, not rays.

🔹 2. Use a Graph-Based Approach
Build a connectivity graph:

Nodes = ray endpoints

Edges only between those that:

Don’t cross land

Share similar directions or distances

Then:

Run connected component analysis (for raw segmentation)

Or spectral clustering / community detection for more nuance

🔹 3. Reframe the Problem as Edge/Boundary Detection
Instead of grouping, focus on finding:

Areas of high endpoint density gradient

Zones where rays terminate abruptly

Transitions in direction or density → boundaries

Think of this as edge detection in a field of ray flows—not clustering at all.

🔹 4. Hybrid Approach: Density + Vector Field
Use a two-stage process:

Detect dense convergence zones (DBSCAN still works here!)

From those zones, identify:

Where rays approach from

Where “boundaries” lie (e.g., compute angular variance or entropy)

🧠 Summary
What we’ve learned:

Adding features is good—but only if the features reflect the thing you want to discover.

DBSCAN can’t “see” relationships unless they’re explicitly encoded.

Rays are directional structures—so their organization matters more than their position alone.

✅ Recommendation
Let’s build a ray density + flow vector map next:

Treat the ocean as a grid or mesh

Compute ray counts and angle aggregates per cell

Use this to detect flow corridors, dead zones, and pinch points

Would you like to move in that direction next? I can help scaffold a vector-density field builder.
